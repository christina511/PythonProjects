start = '''
It's July 20th, 2017. You are walking home from Girls Who Code when
you hear a bewildering groan coming from the Moody's entrance.
Thinking nothing of it, you continue walking to the subway entrance until
hoards of people flood out of the path, screaming in fear. They rush past,
nearly knocking you over. Once they've cleared, you see three grotesque
human-like creatures follow behind.

You lock eyes with them and immediately run into the nearest alleyway.
There you see a lead pipe on the ground and a ladder leading up to the roof.
